WWIVType.EXE
Version 2.0
Minor bug fixes from version 1.5
By Ivan Cooper
This program is distributed as part of WWIV Screenedit 2.0.


This program displays WWIV format files. To use it, just type:

WWIVTYPE [drive][directory][filename/mask]

It will use the colors and mode specified in the DEFAULTS.WWS file if it exists
in the current directory.  Otherwise the default colors will be used.
If you dont put in a parameter, the current directory will be displayed, and
you will be prompted for a pathname.
