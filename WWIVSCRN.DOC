Introduction:

What is WWIV Screenedit?
WWIV screenedit is a program for IBM compatible computers which is designed
to make menus or screens for a WWIV BBS.  It is similar in operation to the
ANSI editor TheDraw (copyright TheSoft), but saves its pictures in either WWIV
or text format (more on these later).

Why don't I use TheDraw, or some other ANSI editor?
Well you could use them, but this has advantages over any other color screen
editor in that it is designed for use with WWIV (although pictures saved in
TEXT format can be used with anything you please) --
 * For every actual line of text, one line is generated. What this means is
   that ANSI codes are not used to advance to the next line, it just uses
   a cr/lf.  Therefore it saves the disk space used by the ANSI code to advance
   to the next line, and it can be viewed in a scroll back buffer.

 * The user's custom color setup is used in the screen. This means that if
   the user has mono, the mono colors will be used in the screen, if he has
   NO ansi, then the screen won't be colored, or if the user just prefers a
   particular color combination it is used.

 * The WWIV color codes take up (here's the key words) A LOT LESS SPACE than
   ansi color change codes!

 * Screenedit allows you to load and save menu files DIRECTLY to and from
   MENUSANS.MSG/MENUS.MSG, the menu files for WWIV.

Now isn't that great?  Well, I guess I'll JUST HAVE TO tell you the downside(s)
of using my most excellent program:
-Not as many color combinations. You only get the 8 that the user has set up in
 his defaults (Or if you have the 2 extra colors mod, you get 10).  You can get
 255 (16 foreground colors, 8 background colors, and blinking on/off) with
 normal ANSI.
-No animation. The only thing you can do is change colors.
-My program doesnt have all the nifty features of a program like TheDraw, and
 some of the features aren't nearly as fast.

(note: Excuse my rotten documentation.)
Ok, now all of this stuff:

WWIV Screenedit 3.2 was written on a RYNO XT Clone with Turbo Pascal v5.5 by
Ivan Cooper.  The source code is 74,633 bytes.  (I put the block functions
in an include file)

Distribution: This program is in the public domain. It may be distributed
freely, but no fee may be charged (except a distribution fee to cover costs)
for the program, and the files WWIVSCRN.EXE, WWIVSCRN.DOC, WWIVTYPE.EXE, and
WWIVTYPE.DOC should be distributed together.

Version History:

Version:  Updates/bug fixes:
--------  --------------------------------------------

1.0       Original version.
2.0       Added 2 extra colors, Mono color set, and the ability to read from
          the WWIV menu files.  Also, it now checks for free disk space before
          saving.
2.1       Quick bug fix from 2.0
3.0       Added a lot of speed optimizations, more special effects, use of
          status message, more block options, ability to save directly to
          menufiles, mark bottom line, and menufile directory. MAKEMSG is not
          included anymore.
3.2       A few bug fixes, improved WWIVTYPE, and VIEW now can view menu files.

Starting WWIV Screenedit:
Note! If you're upgrading from 1.0, DELETE the DEFAULTS.WWS file! The format
is changed in version 2 (v3.0 WILL use the defaults file from 2.x).  Also,
Remember, if you DON'T have the 2 extra colors mod in on your BBS, DONT use
either of the 'extra' colors! Well, in case you hadn't already guessed, type
WWIVSCRN at your dos prompt. When you start it for the first time, it will
create a file called DEFAULTS.WWS. This file contains the default color setup,
default mono setup, name of the file to automatically load, default mode
(color/mono), and whether or not you want special effects.

Cursor Movement:
You can use the 4 arrow keys to move the cursor around, and in addition the
following keys may be used to postion the cursor:

Home     Go to the start of the line     End      Go to the end of the line
PgUp     Go to the bottom of the screen  PgDn     Go to the top of the screen
CtrlHome Go to the top left corner       CtrlEnd  Go to the bottom left corner
CtrlPgUp Go to the top right corner      CtrlPgDn Go to the bottom right corner


Status display:
Once the program is started, the first 23 rows of the screen are blank
(assuming that you havent changed your default autofile) and the bottom 2 lines
look something like this:

WWIV Screenedit!  Color  Version 3.0 - Press ALT-H for help  File:   NONAME.ANS
( 1, 1)  Color 0 Ovr  Set 1: F1=Ú F2=¿ F3=À F4=Ù F5=Ä F6=³ F7=Ã F8=´ F9=Á F10=Â

The coordinates are displayed in the form '( x, y)'.  The 'Color x' message
signifys the current drawing color (or 'Extra x' if you are using color #8 or
#9), and is displayed in that color. The 'Ovr' message signifys Overwrite mode,
and can be toggled to 'Ins' (insert mode) by pressing the Ins key.  Next, you
see the current fkey set. The function key sets are so that you can use the
extended ascii codes without having to actually enter them. Each function key
(1-10) stands for an extended ascii character.  Press Alt-F to see the 10
different fkey sets, and ALT-F(1-10) to select a new set.  Then, there's my
little special effect thinggy (you CAN turn it off if it annoys you), the
status message, and the name of whatever file is currently loaded (defaults to
NONAME.ANS, or the name of the autofile if the autofile exists).

Hotkeys:
Alt-A     Select one of the 10 colors (dont use 8 & 9 if you dont have the 2
          extra colors mod!)
Alt-B     Block functions: Copy/Move/Erase/Fill (with character or color)
Alt-C     Clear the image
Alt-D     Alter the color or mono sets(depending on the current mode).
          Note: When the defaults file is first created, colors 0-7 are set up
          for the default colors for WWIV BBSs (colors 8 & 9 are also set up,
          but I dont really know what the defaults for those are, so you will
          prbably have to change those 2). So, you should generally keep 0-7
          as they are, so that they will appear correctly on users with their
          colors set up to the WWIV default. However, if you have put in a mod
          of some sort that changes WWIV's default colors for new users with
          ansi, then change these accordingly. Remember, no matter HOW you have
          this set up, the picture will be viewed in the colors of whatever
          user is viewing the picture.

Alt-E     Edit Setup. This option allows you to turn my special effect on or
          off, choose a file that will be automatically loaded (if it exists
          in the directory you started the program in), select default mode
          (color or mono), and set up the default color set and mono set,
          which are loaded when you start the program, or press Alt-O. If you
          change the colors, and dont want to hassle changing them back, just
          exit the program and delete DEFAULTS.WWS.
Alt-F     Show all the function key sets.
Alt-H     Display help screen
Alt-I     Insert a line at cursor position. Warning! The bottom line will be
          lost!
Alt-J     Jump to DOS temporarily
Alt-K     Save current picture to WWIV Menu file
Alt-L     Load a screen
Alt-M     Toggle between Color and Mono mode
Alt-N     Ruler
Alt-O     Reset color setup to starting defaults
Alt-R     Draw a rectangle
Alt-S     Save the current screen
Alt-T     Center a line of text
Alt-U     Switch to the color under the cursor
Alt-V     View a file. Just shows a WWIV Screenedit file on the screen, but
          keeps the current picture in memory.
Alt-W     Show list of menus stored in a WWIV menufile
Alt-X     Exit WWIV Screenedit
Alt-Y     Delete current line
Alt-Z     Load a menu from a WWIV menufile
Ctrl Left/Right    Up/Down one color

Other useful keys:
Ins         Toggle between Insert and Overwrite mode- In insert mode, any
            characters will be inserted at the current cursor position, and in
            overwrite mode, the character at the cursor position will be
            written over.
Del         Delete the character at the cursor postion
Alt-F(1-10) Select function key set 1-10

Enter       Move to the first column of the next line. If insert is on, then
            a line will be inserted and the rest of the current line will be
            moved to the start of the next line.

Any ASCII character from ascii #32 to #255 will be placed at the cursor
position. (if in insert mode, the rest of the line will be moved right)

When you save a file, it will ask you to move the cursor to the bottom line
of the screen-On a picture/menu that doesnt go to the bottom line of the
screen (row 23), move the cursor to the last row used by the menu. Otherwise
just move to the bottom row of the screen.  The X position doesn't matter.

Well, since I'm going to assume that you can figure it out from that, (it
works very much like TheDraw) ... That's all, folks!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          Technical file information:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TEXT format:
The files are just written to disk in ASCII format, no colors.

WWIV format:
To make a color change, an ASCII #3 (^C) and a digit from 0-9 is used (to
signify which of the colors to change to).  Note that the color setup info
is not saved in the file, so if one user has his colors set up differently
than another, the file will look different to each of them. This works the
same way as a ^P-x in posting a message.  Consequently, a user with MONO
will get the mono color set, and a user with no ansi at all will not get any
colors.


Note- WWIV also uses another character, ascii #2 in the first column, which is
      used to signify that the line is centered.  WWIV Screenedit CAN
      understand these when loading, but does not use them when saving.
      If you know of any other WWIV special character codes, tell me so that
      I can implement them in the next version.


Size optimization:
WWIV Screenedit will try to optimize the file somewhat, to make the output
file as small as possible.  On each line, it writes every character and color
change up to the point where there are no more characters except spaces, and
those spaces have a zero background color (this means that the color setup IS
used, to see if the background colors of the spaces are zero).  I plan to add
more optimizations later on, and use the #2 (center line) character in saving.

WWIV Menufiles:
In a WWIV menu file, the menus are stored like this:

`0============================================================================
<menu #0 here>
`1============================================================================
<menu #1 here>
etc
