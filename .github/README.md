WWIV Screenedit (WWIVSCRN) for MS-DOS with WWIVTYPE viewer for `.MSG` files.

## Background

I wrote this in 1990 after learning Pascal and used it to edit custom menus
and screens for WWIV BBSs. I had only distributed binaries, but just found the
source code on an old floppy disk. This is the first real complete software
application I ever wrote and distributed.

Original documentation:

 * [WWIVTYPE.DOC](../WWIVTYPE.DOC)
